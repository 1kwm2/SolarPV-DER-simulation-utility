# Utilitiy for simulating dynamics of PV-DER

Solar photovoltaic distributed energy resources (PV-DER) are power electronic inverter based generation (IBG) connected to the electric power distribution system (eg. roof top solar PV systems). This utility can be used to simulate the behaviour a single DER connected to a stiff voltage source as shown in the following schematic:

## Basics
The dynamics of the DER are modelled using dynamic phasors. Detailed description of the concepts behind this utility can be found in the IEEE publication **Dynamic Modeling of Solar PV Systems for Distribution System Stability Analysis** and detailed list of equations can be found in the [Model specification document.](docs/PV_DER_model_specification_rev3.docx)

* API Documentation: https://solarpv-der-simulation-utility.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Installation
You can install the module directly from github with following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/sibyjackgrove/SolarPV-DER-simulation-utility.git
cd SolarPV-DER-simulation-utility
pip install -e .
```
## Using the module
The module can be imported as a normal python module:
```
import pvder
```
The following features are available currently:
1. Single phase or three phase DER models.
2. Run simulation in stand alone mode with internal grid voltage source model.
3. Run simulation in loop mode where grid voltage is supplied every time step by outside program.
4. Introduce solar insolation events (in all modes), grid voltage, and frequency change events (in stand alone mode).
5. Enable Low voltage ride through (LVRT) and Volt-VAR control logic. 

### Using the stand alone single phase DER model with 10 kW power rating
The following steps are required:
1. First import the following classes:
```
from pvder.DER_components_single_phase import SolarPV_DER_SinglePhase
from pvder.grid_components import Grid
from pvder.dynamic_simulation import DynamicSimulation
from pvder.simulation_events import SimulationEvents
from pvder.simulation_utilities import SimulationResults
```
1. Create a **_SimulationEvents_** object: This object is used to add or remove disturbance events occurs during the simulation.
```
events = SimulationEvents()
```
2. Create a **Grid** object: This object describes the steady state model for the grid voltage source. It needs to be supplied with an **_SimulationEvents_** object.
```
grid = Grid(events=events)
```
3. Create a **SolarPV_DER_SinglePhase** or **SolarPV_DER_ThreePhase** object: This object describes the dynamic DER model. It needs both an **_SimulationEvents_** object and a **Grid** object. The power rating of the DER are should also be provided.
```
PV_DER = SolarPV_DER_SinglePhase(grid_model=grid,events=events,Sinverter_rated = 10.0e3,standAlone = True)
```
4. Create a **DynamicSimulation** object: This object runs the simulation and stores the solution. It takes **_SimulationEvents_**, **Grid** and, **SolarPV_DER_SinglePhase** objects as arguments.
```
sim = DynamicSimulation(grid_model=grid,PV_model=PV_DER,events = events)
```
5. Create a **SimulationResults** object: This object is used to visualize the simulation results.
```
results = SimulationResults(simulation = sim)
```
6. Add an event (for e.g. solar insolation change at 10.0 s):
```
events.add_solar_event(10,90)
```
7. Specify simulation flags (for e.g. set the DEBUG_SIMULATION and DEBUG_POWER flag to true to observe the power at each time step.):
```
sim.DEBUG_SIMULATION = False
sim.DEBUG_POWER = False
```
8. Specify simulation stop time (for e.g. 20.0 s):
```
sim.tStop = 20.0
```
9. Run the simulation:
```
sim.run_simulation()
```
10. Visualize the results (for e.g. the power output at PCC-LV side):
```
results.PER_UNIT = False
results.plot_DER_simulation(plot_type='active_power_Ppv_Pac_PCC')
```
